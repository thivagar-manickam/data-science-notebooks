This is the famous Titanic prediction problem.

In this notebook I have covered the pre-processing of the data and 
concentrated more on the Exploratory Data Analysis part.

I have also performed the Linear Regression model building to further understand
the relationship between each of the features. 

At the end I have done the prediction the XGBoost ML model.

You can refer to the details about this dataset and the problem statement in the  [Kaggle Site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)
